React defines very few [components](Component.md) on its own. Most of the content provided by the `react` package are hooks and API calls for handling [effects](Effects.md), [transitions](Transitions.md), [refs](Refs.md), [transitions](Transitions.md), [state](State.md) as well as providing some mechanisms for handling [lazy behavior](Lazy%20Mechanisms.md).
